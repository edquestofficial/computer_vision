# ðŸš— Vehicle Entry Counter using YOLOv8 & OpenCV

This project uses **[Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)** and **OpenCV** to detect and count vehicles crossing a designated line in a video.  
It tracks vehicles (car, motorbike, bus, truck) and increments the count when they cross the **entry line**.

- âœ… Real-time vehicle detection and tracking using YOLOv8  
- âœ… Counts vehicles **crossing the entry line** (downward direction)  
- âœ… Supports multiple vehicle types: **car, motorbike, bus, truck**  
- âœ… Uses **persistent object IDs** to avoid double counting
